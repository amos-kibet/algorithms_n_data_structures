"""
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s. 
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with 0(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
Output: ["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]

Constraints:
  1. 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
  2. s[i] is a printable ascii character
